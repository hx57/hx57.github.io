## About
ICON Community Alliance (ICA) was formed to harness collective intelligence from the ICON community, focusing on education, marketing, public relations, local representation, community outreach, and other business development opportunities. ICA is run by a group (HX57) of ICON enthusiasts, offering to promote ICON and help its adoption, on a voluntary basis. The alliance's ultimate goal will align with ICON foundation's vision, to hyperconnect the world.
